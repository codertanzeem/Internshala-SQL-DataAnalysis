# PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
## IPL Auction

## Objective:
Developing an auction strategy for a new IPL franchise by analyzing past IPL data to build a strong and balanced squad.

## Background:
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India, held annually between March or April and May. Established by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007, the league features eight teams representing different cities or states. It is the most-attended cricket league globally and ranked sixth in average attendance among all sports leagues in 2014. The IPL was also the first sports event to be broadcast live on YouTube in 2010. According to Duff & Phelps, the IPL's brand value was approximately â‚¹475 billion (US$6.7 billion) in 2020. The tournament format includes a double round-robin where each team plays every other team twice, followed by playoffs for the top four teams. The playoffs include Qualifier 1, an Eliminator, and Qualifier 2, leading to the final match to crown the IPL champion. Over the past ten seasons, thirteen teams have participated, with five no longer part of the tournament. The Kochi Tuskers Kerala and Deccan Chargers were terminated due to contractual breaches, Pune Warriors India exited over a valuation disagreement, and Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were suspended but later reinstated. In the 2020 season, the league featured teams like Delhi Capitals, Punjab Kings, and Mumbai Indians, with the latter winning five titles. As a new team is set to join the IPL, a mega auction is planned to build the squad.

## Key Considerations for Auction Strategy:

* Budget Allocation: The team must decide on a budget and determine spending limits for each player.

* Team Needs: Identifying the required positions and types of players to target in the auction is crucial.

* Player Availability: Consideration of players' current contracts and international commitments is necessary.

* Player Form and Value: Assessing players' recent performances and market value will help in making informed bidding decisions.

To form a balanced squad, the management needs to weigh these factors carefully. A strategy might include targeting key players, utilizing player retention and Right to Match options, and balancing marquee signings with value picks. The data analysis team plays a crucial role in gathering and analyzing data on players, including past performances and other relevant metrics, to create player profiles and rankings. This analysis will guide the management in creating a targeted list of players for the auction and planning the bidding process.

# Data Handling:
You have access to IPL data from the first to the 13th season. Analyze this data thoroughly before loading it into your SQL server.

# Bidding Strategy for Batters:

* Aggressive Batsmen: Important for quick scoring and putting pressure on the opposition. Focus on acquiring 2-3 players with high strike rates who have faced at least 500 balls.

* Anchor Batsmen: Essential for stability and consistency. Aim to acquire 2-3 players with good averages who have participated in at least two IPL seasons.

* Hard Hitters: Key for scoring runs in crucial moments. Target players who have scored most of their runs in boundaries and have played more than two IPL seasons.

# Bidding Strategy for Bowlers:

* Economical Bowlers: Important for controlling the scoring rate and maintaining pressure. Seek out 2-3 bowlers with good economy rates who have bowled at least 500 balls.

* Wicket-Taking Bowlers: Crucial for breaking partnerships and applying pressure. Focus on acquiring 2-3 bowlers with good strike rates who have bowled at least 500 balls.

# Bidding Strategy for All-Rounders:

* All-Rounders: Valuable for their versatility, providing both batting and bowling options. Target all-rounders who can contribute in multiple areas and offer flexibility in team composition.
This approach will help in building a competitive and well-rounded squad, ready to compete in the upcoming IPL season.
